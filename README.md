# TaoDAO

we´re co-creating new web3 wealth generators
for this decisive 3rd decade of 21th century

since 2021 taoDAO has been co-creating through  ways to organically P2P interconnect regen projects through an common pool of shareable resources ! got curious ?

check more about it here !

taoDAO has two main goals: the co-creation of constructive contents while being a pillar for making lives alive

we´re actually 25 proactive co-creators of taoDAO ecosystem from all over Brazil

in this sense taoDAO is not an organization, it´s an interactive glocal organism open to anyone
that vibrates in the same P2P and regen frequency literally co-creating an commons space to host and produce in a decentralized manner content about
all sorts of initiatives , projects and endeavours (DAOs) that are reframing the very conception of wealth and weaving in between numerous social worlds regenerative patterns of livelihood for everyone.

curious fact >>>> São Bernardo do Campo founded as " Vila de Santo André da Borda do Campo " in the early second half of the 1600 of the portuguese colonization (1553), that in the 20th century became the " car capital "of BR, is one of most "cosmopolitan " cities due to all sorts of worldwide immigration in the end of the 1900, but the most curious fact is that it actually wouldn´t exist if the guaianases indigenous tribe throughTibiriça, it´s chieftain at the time didn´t support it.
